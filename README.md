This package makes your endpoints idempotent easily.

Check out this [Stripe Blog Post](https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency) about Idempotency.

Implementation inspired by [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests).

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Adding support idempotency requests to your APIs easily by adding a middleware.
- Works only for `POST` requests. Other endpoints are ignored.
- Record and replay only successful(2xx) and server-side errors(5xx) responses, without touching your controller again.
- it's safe to retry, it doesn't record the response with client-side errors (4xx).
- To prevent accidental misuse of the cached responses, the request's signature is validated to ensure that the cached response is returned using the same combination of Idempotency-Key and Request.
- Concurrency protection using Laravel's atomic locks to prevent race conditions.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require bvtterfly/replay
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="replay-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
use Bvtterfly\Replay\StripePolicy;

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Cache Store
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This option controls the cache store that gets used while Replay will store the
    | information required for it to function.
    | By default, Replay will use the default cache store.
    |
    | Please see config/cache.php for the list of all available Cache Stores.
    |
     */

    'use' => env('REPLY_CACHE_STORE', config('cache.default')),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Reply Master Switch
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Reply is enabled by default,
    | Use this setting to enable/disable the Reply.
    |
    */

    'enabled' => env('REPLAY_ENABLED', true),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Expiration Seconds
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This value controls the number of seconds until an idempotency response
    | is considered expired.
    |
    | The default is set to 1 day.
    |
    */

    'expiration' => 86400,

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Request Header Name
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Reply will check this header name to determine
    | if a request is an Idempotency request.
    |
    */

    'header_name' => 'Idempotency-Key',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Policy
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The policy determines whether a request is idempotent and whether the response should
    |  be recorded.
    |
    */

    'policy' => StripePolicy::class,

];
```

Optionally, you can publish the translations using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="replay-translations"
```

## âœ¨ Server Usage

The `Bvtterfly\Replay\Replay`-middleware must be registered in the kernel:
```php
//app/Http/Kernel.php

protected $routeMiddleware = [
  ...
  'replay' => \Bvtterfly\Replay\Replay,
];
```
Next, For idempotent an endpoint, apply `replay` middleware to it:
```php
Route::post('/payments', function () {
    //
})->middleware('replay');
```


### Custom Policy

Reply use Policy to determine whether a request is idempotent and whether the response should be recorded. By default, Reply includes and uses `StripePolicy` Policy.
To create your custom policy, you first need to implement the `\Butterfly\Replay\Contracts\Policy` contract:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;

interface Policy
{
    public function isIdempotentRequest(Request $request): bool;

    public function isRecordableResponse(Response $response): bool;
}
```
If you want to view an example implementation take a look at the `StripePolicy` class.

For using this policy, We can change the `policy` in the config file.

## âœ¨ Client Usage

To perform an idempotent request, Client must provide an additional `Idempotency-Key : <key>` header with a unique key to the request.

it is recommended to:
- Use "V4 UUIDs" for the creation of the idempotency unique keys (e.g. `07cd2d27-e0dc-466f-8193-28453e9c3023`).

Once Replay detects a key, it'll look it up in cache store. If found, it will serve the same response without hitting your controller action again.

If Replay can't find the key, it attempts to acquire a cache lock and caches successful or server error responses. Still, if it can't acquire the lock, another request with the same key is already in progress, then it will respond with the HTTP Conflict response status code.
